# django-chat
Heroku hosted chat using Websockets.


*Dependencies:*
```
python
pipenv
docker
```

Note 1: UNFINISHED EXAMPLE REPO, ONGOING WORK! The plan is to implement stored chat service with user registration. Frontend will probably be REACT.
Note 2: To run locally you currently need docker and redis, as I have not split up the prod/dev settings.
Also note that I WILL change the SECRET_KEY when finalizing the project.
